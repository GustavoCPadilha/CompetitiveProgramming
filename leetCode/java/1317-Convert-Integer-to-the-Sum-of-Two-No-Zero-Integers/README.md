# 📝 LeetCode 1317 - Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers

## 💡 Description

Given an integer `n`, return a list of two integers `[a, b]` such that:

- `a + b == n`
- Both `a` and `b` **do not contain the digit '0'** in their decimal representation.

It is guaranteed that at least one valid solution exists.

## 📥 Input

- A single integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴).

## 📤 Output

- Two integers `a` and `b`, such that:
  - `a + b == n`
  - Neither `a` nor `b` contains the digit `'0'`.

## 🔑 Examples

Input: n = 2
Output: [1, 1]
